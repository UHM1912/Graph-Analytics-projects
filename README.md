# Graph Analytics Labs

This repository contains all lab exercises and projects from my Graph Analytics course, with future labs to be added regularly. It is designed as a centralized place to explore graph algorithms, network analysis, and their applications in domains such as financial transactions, social networks, and more.

## Current Contents

-  Lab 1â€“Lab 3: BFS, DFS, transaction networks, and graph traversal visualizations

- Graph construction: From real datasets like bank transactions

- Traversal algorithms: BFS and DFS with visualization

- Pathfinding & network analysis exercises

## Purpose

- To implement and explore graph traversal algorithms

- To analyze real-world networks and relationships

- To provide a reference repository for future graph analytics projects
